Description=The routines contained in this folder are all running on the CH32V103C-R1-1V0 development board, The OpenHarmony LiteOS-M kernel is a lightweight IoT operating system kernel built for the IoT field. It has the characteristics of small size, low power consumption, and high performance. Its code structure is simple. It mainly includes the minimum function set of the kernel, the kernel abstraction layer, and the The selection of components and project catalogs are divided into hardware-related layers and hardware-independent layers. The hardware-related layers provide a unified HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) interface to improve hardware adaptability.
